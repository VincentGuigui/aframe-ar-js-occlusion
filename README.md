# AFRAME and AR.JS with transparent Occlusion plane

Here is a small sample to use [AFrame](https://aframe.io/) and [AR.js](https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js) and a transprent occlusion plane to make an object appears progressively on top on the camera feed.

Very usefull to make an object spawn through an AR marker or through the floor
